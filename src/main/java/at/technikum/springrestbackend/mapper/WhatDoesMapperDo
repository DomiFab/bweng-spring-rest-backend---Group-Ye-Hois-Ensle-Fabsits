Commonly used to map data between DTOs and domain entities.

DTOs are often used to transfer data between the client and the server,
while domain entities/models represent the business objects within the application.
Mappers handle the conversion between these two representations,
ensuring that data is correctly transferred and validated.
Transform data from one format to another. involves copying data from one object to another,
possibly applying data manipulation or conversion logic in the process.

also handle mapping data between domain entities and database entities (e.g., JPA entities).
This involves converting data from the object-oriented representation used in the application
to the relational database representation.

Abstraction of Data Transformation Logic: encapsulate the logic for data transformation,
abstracting it away from the rest of the application. This promotes code reuse, maintainability,
and separation of concerns by keeping the transformation logic isolated in a dedicated component.

can be versioned to handle changes in the data structure over time. allows backward and forward
compatibility between different versions of the application or between different layers of the application.

facilitate testing by providing a clear and consistent way to map data between different
representations. makes it easier to write unit tests.
