*Acts as an intermediary between the client (e.g., web browser, mobile app) and the server-side logic.*

Request Mapping: The controller maps incoming HTTP requests to specific handler
methods based on the request URL and HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
This mapping is typically defined using annotations such as
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, etc.

Request Processing: The handler methods in the controller process the incoming requests.
They may perform various tasks such as retrieving data from the database, invoking business
logic methods from the service layer, performing data validation, and so on.

Data Binding: The controller binds request data (e.g., request parameters, request body) to
method parameters or objects. This allows the controller to access and process the data sent
by the client in the request.

Response Generation: The handler methods in the controller generate an appropriate HTTP response
based on the outcome of request processing. This response may include data (e.g., JSON, XML) to be
sent back to the client, along with an HTTP status code and any necessary headers.

Exception Handling: The controller may handle exceptions that occur during request processing.
It can catch and handle exceptions gracefully, returning meaningful error responses to the client.
