primary purpose is to implement the business logic of the application. This includes the rules,
workflows, and operations that define how the application behaves and processes data.

Abstraction Layer over the repository or data access layer. They encapsulate the details of data access
and manipulation, allowing the rest of the application to interact with the business logic without needing
to know about the underlying data storage implementation.

Transaction Management: ensuring that multiple database operations are performed atomically and consistently.
They may define transaction boundaries and coordinate the execution of multiple operations within a
single transaction.

Validate incoming data to ensure that it meets the requirements and constraints of the application.
This includes validating user input, enforcing business rules, and performing data integrity checks.

Error Handling: Services handle exceptions and errors that occur during the execution of business logic.
They may catch and handle exceptions gracefully, returning meaningful error responses to the client.

May orchestrate the execution of multiple operations or workflows to fulfill a specific request or use case.
May coordinate the interaction between multiple components of application, such as other services or repositories.

Implement Cross-cutting Concerns: such as logging, caching, security, and authentication. applied to
all operations performed by the service and ensure consistency and reliability across the application.
